# Rainbow ToDo's

#### [**Live Website**](https://noemichis.github.io/rainbow-todos/)

A simple and colorful ToDo List project to organize daily tasks. It is created to be responsive on all screen sizes so users can easily access it from anywhere and offers control buttons for easy and intuitive interaction. 

## User goals 

- Quickly understand the purpose of the site.
- Easily interact with the page: 
    - add tasks.
    - update tasks.
    - mark tasks complete.
    - delete tasks when no longer applicable.
- Enjoy the design and colors to boost the day.

## Design

I wanted the site to be simple, easy to use, but colorful, happy and lively as for me these are the main characteristics I usually look for in a product. 

The colors were chosen with the color pallette generator [Coolors](https://coolors.co). Once I had the colors I used a linear-gradient CSS function to create a rainbow-like effect.

Fonts used in the project were `Quicksand` for the main heading and `Source Sans Pro` for the body of the page, both having a sans-serif font as backup. They were imported from [Google Fonts](http://fonts.google.com).

The icons are sourced from [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/) and were made by [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/) in a lineal color style, which gives them a playful appearance.
